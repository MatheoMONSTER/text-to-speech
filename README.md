This is a very simple text to speech program written using python. 

To launch the program you need to open up Powershell (Windows users) or Terminal (Linux users) and type the following command: 
cd/file-location, then you need to type: python3 tts.py 

After launching the application you need to enter some text as provided in the app. After entering some text you will see the prompt to open up mp3 player,
and then you will hear your written message. 

In order to change the language of text to speech app you can simply edit "lang" for example: lang="en". 

Enjoy.
